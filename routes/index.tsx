          The javascript community, and I personally, really want to see Deno
          succeed. This site is not intended to "dunk" on Deno in any way. It's
          simply my way of listing what I see as its current shortcomings and
          what I hope it can improve on.

          The fact that this page needs updating is a fantastic sign that Deno
          is headed in the right direction.

          forward in the world of potential supply-chain attacks.

        <h3 id="module-ecosystem" class="text-2xl">Module Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>
          Deno now does have nearly the module support of node with the release
          and stabilization of npm specifiers. While the compatibility isn't
          100% there, and there are still some issues with the compat layer's
          implementation of things like websocket and https, it is now perfectly
          usuable and no longer the huge problem it was.

          Deno is currently sluggish in comparison to Node and especially in
          comparison to something like Go.

        <p>
          People say this a lot but I want to be a little more concrete about
          it. One way I find to check really quickly if something is mature is
          to see what big issues are left to be resolved. I'm going to do a
          quick list of what issues I consider big and an elevator pitch on why
          each is imporant.

            Remove pure JS (non native) io functions from Deno namespace
          </a>{" "}
          - The Deno namespace has a few methods that shouldn't be there. Using
          any Deno namespace call instantly makes your code incompatible with
          the browser and thus isn't great. Moving any code that *should* be
          browser-compatible to the standard library would fix this.

            Detached processes in deno
          </a>{" "}
          - Deno can't currently run a child process in detached mode. This is a
          pretty big oversight but it's niche enough to probably not effect you
          directly.

            Default to h and Fragment for JSX
          </a>{" "}
          - Deno has not finalized its default tsconfig yet. For a runtime with
          supposed "first class" support for typescript, this not being nailed
          down isn't great.

        <h3 id="stack-overflow" class="text-2xl">Stack Overflow</h3>

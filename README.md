## Motivation

The javascript community, and I personally, really want to see Deno succeed.
This site is not intended to "dunk" on Deno in any way. It's simply my way of
listing what I see as its current shortcomings and what I hope it can improve
on.

I would like to additionally clarify that I'm not here to criticize any design
decisions. Some people think that having opinionated software is bad. I
disagree, it makes life a lot easier. Unless there are fundamental limitations
with the current toolkit, I will not add anything about it "not being
configurable enough".

## Contributing

Is any information wrong or out of date? Submit an issue or a PR. Are there any
large libraries (>100 GH stars) that don't support Deno? Submit an issue or a
PR.

## Run Locally

Start the project:

```bash
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
